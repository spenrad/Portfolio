Portfolio
====

# Description
This is a simple version of a portfolio displaying a sample of my body of work.

----

# What's inside??
Constructed using mostly HTML and Bootstrap, this portfolio minimally displays projects I have chosen as well as ways to contact me and view my web-presence. Additionally a link that automatically downloads my resume is on the hompepage as well.

----

# Improvements
As I learn more methods to build webpages, the portfolio will be updated to reflect that.
